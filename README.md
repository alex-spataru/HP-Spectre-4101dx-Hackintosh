# Hackintosh with HP Spectre x360 13

OpenCore configuration files, installation guides and resources to run macOS on the HP Spectre 13-4101dx (may work with similar devices, but there is no guarantee).

**Disclaimer:** This project is still in alpha/beta stage. Proceed at your own risk, and feel free to report issues and contribute to this guide :)

#### Supported macOS versions

- macOS Catalina (tested with 10.15.5 & 10.15.6, [instalation notes...](Catalina_10.15/))
- macOS Big Sur (WIP, [instalation notes...](BigSur_10.16/))

**Note:** I got the computer to boot and work decently with Big Sur. However, the Big Sur project is on pause until the OS is more widely tested, I ran into many issues regarding the OS itself (rather than my Hackintosh config), any effort as of now could be invalidated in the near future with a substantial bug fix/update. For the momnent, I'll continue working on improving Catalina support.
